## AgentOps Replay — Log, visualize & replay agent workflows for debugging and compliance

Enterprises deploy agentic systems without clear observability or auditability. When an agent misbehaves, teams can’t easily tell what was prompted, which tools were called, or why a decision happened. AgentOps Replay fixes this by providing a durable, agent‑agnostic tracing and replay layer that captures each step (prompts, tool calls, inputs/outputs, parameters, timestamps), visualizes the workflow, and supports deterministic sandbox replay for debugging and compliance.

What we built during the hackathon
- FastAPI backend that ingests GitHub webhooks and triggers a multi‑agent pipeline (Architect → Deps → Tests → Deploy → IncidentMonitor).
- Universal agent logger that emits structured status + trace events (LLM/tool I/O, agent deltas) to a registered webhook for live UIs.
- Deterministic replay: fetch full timelines and re‑broadcast with original timing; sandbox re‑run that substitutes recorded outputs.
- Intuitive React Flow timeline where the user can see detailed event logs + agent outputs for each individual agent
- Optional MongoDB persistence for history; optional compliance actions: auto GitHub Issues/PRs and Gmail notifications to commit authors.

Who benefits
- Platform/AppSec/SRE teams who need transparent, replayable agent runs for debugging and audit.
- Product teams who want faster iteration with deterministic reproduction of failures.

What works today (why it’s impressive)
- End‑to‑end traces with minimal integration: register one webhook URL and receive structured events in real time.
- Deterministic sandbox replay of any prior run; timelines are durable and agent outputs are substituted.
- Automated incident handling: health probes, dependency risk notes, AI test proposals, Issue/PR creation, and author emails via Gmail API.

AgentOps Replay turns opaque agent behavior into a browsable, replayable story—reducing MTTR, improving trust, and enabling compliance reviews.
